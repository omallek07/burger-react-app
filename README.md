This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## MyBurger App

Description: MyBurger allows users to create an account, customize a burger, and fill out delivery information to have the burger "delivered" to their address.  Their orders and user information persist in a Firebase database and users can access all of their previous orders.  

Web project was instructed by Maximillian Schwarzmueller in this course: https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/v4/content

What the course focused on:

The "What", "Why" and "How"
React Basics (Base features, syntax and concepts)
How to output lists and conditional content
Styling of React components
A deep dive into the internals of React and advanced component features
How to access Http content from within React apps (AJAX)
Redux, Redux, Redux ... from basics to advanced!
Forms and form validation in React apps
Authentication
An introduction to unit testing
An introduction to Next.js
React app deployment instructions
...and much more!


Personal Goals to refine with project:

- Add more tests for backend and frontend (Mocha, Chai, and Enzyme)
- Add further responsiveness to purchasing UI (i.e. viewport jump when button is clicked)
- Add administrative features to access all orders and change or update delivery status
